# `@angle-measurer/framework-bindings`

This space is reserved for services and interfaces which provide ready-state signals and other bindings to the framework currently being tested. This folder (/subfolders) will also concern itself with implementations of supported frameworks.

Intended useage:

The appropriate concretion will be supplied to the codebase at runtime, as a dependency.
