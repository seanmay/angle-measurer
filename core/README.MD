# `@angle-measurer/core`

Contains classes and services which are required to bootstrap a protractor instance, either via API, or via CLI command instance. It contains the core ability to run test suites, and the core logic to function as a testing tool.

The intent is to provide a system for streamlined bootstrapping of default builds for AngularJS / Angular, while also allowing for end-user composition of different implementations of dependencies.
