# `@angle-measurer/domain`

Contains all types/interfaces/models which are proven to be dependencies of multiple modules.  

This is so domain objects can be used by any module, from the same path, while also allowing external projects / plugins / et cetera, to have access to type information, without being tied to the whole application.
